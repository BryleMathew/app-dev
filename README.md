# my favorite movie: Lucy

##"Lucy" is a 2014 English-language French science fiction action film directed by Luc Besson. The movie stars Scarlett Johansson as the titular character, Lucy, an American student in Taipei who is tricked into becoming a drug mule for a South Korean drug lord. After a bag of a powerful synthetic drug called CPH4 is surgically implanted into her abdomen, it leaks into her system when she is assaulted, granting her superhuman abilities.
